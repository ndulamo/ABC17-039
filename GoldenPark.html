    <h1>The Golden Gate Park</h1>
   <p>Much as San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge was deemed "The Bridge That Couldn't Be Built", the 1,000+ acres of terrain once known as the "Outside Lands" wasn't a promising sight for a park. In 1871, field engineer William Hammond Hill and master gardener John McLaren carved out an urban oasis that was later named Golden Gate Park.
        </p> 
    <p>Today, the park is home to a wealth of San Francisco's most-visited attractions, including the Japanese Tea Garden, the San Francisco Botanical Garden, the de Young Museum, and the California Academy of Sciences. Golden Gate Park sees more than 24 million visitors annually, making it the third most-visited city park in the United States.
