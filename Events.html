    <h2>Events that showcase San Francisco</h2>
    <article style="width: 100%">
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Because San Francisco has a long history of cherishing outrageous self-expression, and of being a place where everyone is always welcome, you can dress up just about any way you like when you're here. It all began with the Summer of Love, when style in the city radically broke from the conformity of the era. Of course, it’s no fun to dress up alone. So, San Franciscans created parties, parades and other events to show off their original style for any chance to break out something from their costume closet (the true test of a local). That legacy can still be felt today in these events that happen across the city. Whether you want to improve your Instagram feed by observing or debut your own ensemble, there's something for everyone
        </p>
        
        <h2>Past events</h2>
        
        <h3>Brides of March</h3>
        
        <p>
        No, this one has nothing to do with Julius Caesar. The Brides of March is a silly gathering that riffs on the famous date in history and invites all comers—male or female—to don a wedding dress and join a pub crawl through Union Square. The event began here 20 years ago and has now spread across the country.
        </p>
        
        <h3>SFJAZZ Center (201 Franklin St.)</h3>
        
        <p>SFJAZZ has been at the helm of the city's jazz scene since its founding in the 1980s. Beyond preserving the history of this musical form so tied to the African-American experience, SFJAZZ now blazes a trail for the artists of the future in its permanent home on Franklin St. Few performance venues in the city have the sound quality of the SFJAZZ Center.
        </p>
        
        <h3>LepreCon</h3>
        
        <p>
        Show off your shamrocks on St. Patrick's Day along Polk Street for one of San Francisco's biggest annual bar crawls. Don your most creative Celtic costuming and visit as many of the favorite neighborhood bars as you (responsibly) can. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Warfield (982 Market St.)</h3>
        
        <p>
        Among the oldest venues in San Francisco, The Warfield has hosted a number of great black artists, including Louis Armstrong and Prince. The Warfield brings in all kinds of performers and every style of music. Whether you're in a seat in the balcony or dancing on the main floor, you'll have a great concert experience.
        
        </p>
        
        <h3>Bring Your Own Big Wheel Race</h3>
        
        <p>
        Recapture your youth at the Bring Your Own Big Wheel Race. Held every spring, this only-in-San Francisco event sees costumed competitors congregate at the intersection of 20th and Vermont Streets in Potrero Hill. They then ride down the precarious hill on their tiny plastic vehicles. We're not kidding about the course; this stretch of Vermont Street is narrower, steeper, and "crooked-er" than famous Lombard Street!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Coming in summer of 2021</h2>
        
        <h3>Carnaval</h3>
        
        <p>Embrace the whole Latin world in the streets of the Mission District, with this weekend-long celebration of samba, salsa and more. Parade performers are decked out in elaborate, traditional outfits celebrating their international cultures. Make sure your own plumage turns a few heads.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Yoshi’s (1330 Fillmore St.)</h3>
        
        <p>
        Yoshi’s started small, taking up a single room next to a sushi restaurant. However, its noteworthy lineup of local and national entertainers led to a rapid expansion. Today, Yoshi’s operates two popular nightclubs, one in Oakland's Jack London Square, and another on San Francisco's Fillmore Street. From the talented Black Art Jazz Collective to Grammy-nominated jazz saxophonist Gerald Albright, there is a constant stream of extraordinary artists on-stage, making this a top choice for locals and visitors to the Bay Area.
        </p>
        
        <h3>San Francisco Pride</h3>
        
        <p>You’ll find every color of the rainbow at San Francisco Pride. What began as a handful of angry marchers in 1970 has blossomed into a proud and positive million-person-plus extravaganza. Be a part of this diverse celebration.
