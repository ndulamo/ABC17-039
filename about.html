               <h1> The early history</h1>
        <p> In the early 19th century whaling ships and traders came to the bay. Then in 1821 Mexico (which included California) broke away from Spain and became a republic. Then in 1828 Jedediah Smith crossed the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach San Francisco Bay. An Englishman called William Richardson founded a settlement by San Francisco bay in 1835. He called it Yerba Buena. During the 1830s and early 1840s many Americans came to live in the new settlement. </p><div>

      <p>Then in 1846 the USA annexed California. On 9 July 1846 USS Portsmouth sailed into San Francisco Bay and sailors and marines went ashore and raised the US flag. The little settlement of Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco (after the bay) on 30 January 1847. At that time San Francisco only had a population of about 800. However, in 1848 a man named James Marshall discovered gold. News of the find reached New York in December 1848. As a result, people went to San Francisco in their thousands and the population boomed. In 1849 the population of San Francisco reached 25,000. However on 4 May 1851 San Francisco was devastated by a fire. However the town was soon rebuilt. San Francisco waterworks began in 1857.However by 1853 the gold boom was ending. Then, in 1859 Henry Comstock discovered silver. Unlike gold the silver required expensive equipment to extract so a number of 'silver barons' were the main beneficiaries. Meanwhile businessmen dreamed of a trans-continental railroad. It was completed in 1869.During the late 19th century San Francisco continued to develop. The first cable car service began in Clay Street in 1873. Meanwhile in 1870 San Francisco had a population of almost 150,000. By 1900 San Francisco had a population of over 300,000.

         <h1>San Francisco in the 20th Century</h1>       
        <p>However on 18 April 1906 at about 5.15 a.m. an earthquake struck San Francisco. It measured 8.25 on the Richter scale and it caused widespread devastation. Yet the fires that followed caused even more destruction. They raged for 3 days. Afterwards about 28,000 buildings were destroyed and 250,000 people were made homeless. The exact number of dead is not known. Yet after the earthquake San Francisco was rebuilt.Meanwhile San Francisco suffered an outbreak of bubonic plague in the years between 1900 and 1904. It killed 113 people. San Francisco suffered an outbreak of bubonic plague between 1907 and 1909. This time 190 people died. Many grand new building were erected in the early 20th century. Hallidie Building was erected in 1917. Saints Peter and Paul Church was built in 1924. Coit Tower was built in 1933. Work on the Golden Gate Bridge began in 1934 and it opened on the 27 May 1937. (Tragically shortly before it opened 11 construction workers were killed).
